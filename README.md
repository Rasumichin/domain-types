# domain-types
A collection of simple domain types which could be added to the base library. I've started to collect some more or less simple domain types or value objects which could be used throughout many projects.

The main intention is to mindfully write clean code applying TDD.

Available types so far:
1. CommaSeparatedValue
1. ...
